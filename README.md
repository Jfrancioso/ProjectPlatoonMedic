# ProjectPlatoonMedic
# PlatoonMedic SQL Database
This is a SQL database project created to support a larger application aimed at helping combat medics in the army track the health of platoon members more effectively.

# Description
As a former line medic for an infantry platoon who has deployed overseas, the creator of this project understands the challenges that medics face when it comes to visualizing, tracking, and interacting with data about soldiers. This database project aims to address those challenges by providing a centralized location for storing data related to soldiers' medical conditions, treatments, and prescriptions, as well as their platoon and medic assignments.

# Installation
To use this database, you can run the SQL scripts included in the project to create the necessary tables and insert data. You can also modify the scripts to customize the database schema to your needs.

# Usage
Once the database is set up, you can query it to retrieve information about soldiers, platoons, medical conditions, treatments, prescriptions, and more. This data can then be used to inform decision-making by medics, platoon leaders, and other stakeholders.

# Feedback
